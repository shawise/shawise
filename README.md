- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a high school student, i would not prefer to reveal any personal information such as my name here. 
- i am very keen and interested in learning about the internet, technology and specially cognitive sciences and artificial intelligence. 
- github seems like a platform where i can find materials and people who have similar interests as mine and just seems you know, even the interface gives that techy vibe which i like.
- so yeah that was about it for my intro ive been here since well quite a while but never posted anything, hope i can find likeminded people. 
- im not working on specifically any project for which i would need collaboraters but always down to learn something new, and can collaborate if the project interests me and is legitimate, in my skills.
- so yeah, i dont really know if like users can dm each other on github or whatev but im pretty sure you can comment, so yeah if u wna reach out just comment on this post.
- thanks, love y'all.
